# Image-processing-using-Verilog
General image operations on a Grayscale Image using Verilog

The design module is able to perform following operations on a grayscale image :- 
1. Increase Brightness
2. Decrease Brightness
3. Image Thresholding
4. Image inversion

The "txt_to_jpg.py" file is used to create a .txt file which contains pixel values of an image in 8-bit binary format.

The obtained text file is then passed into the simulation source file of verilog i.e. "ImageParser.v".
